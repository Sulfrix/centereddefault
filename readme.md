# Centered Default HUD
A TF2 hud that moves many elements close to the center of the screen because I have serious tunnel vision.

Uses Eniere's [Improved Default HUD](https://github.com/Eniere/idhud) as a base.

## Installation
* Remove/disable any other HUD mod you may have
* Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Sulfrix/centereddefault/releases) and download the latest one (just grab the source code zip)
* Extract the contained folder to your `tf/custom` folder
* **Make sure minmode is turned on (cl_hud_minmode 1)**
